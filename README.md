# Real-Time Chat Application

This project is a tutorial on building and deploying a real-time chat application using React.js, Node.js, and Socket.io. The video tutorial walks you through the steps of creating the chat application from scratch, covering both the front-end and back-end development.

## Introduction

The chat application utilizes Socket.IO for real-time data transfer, enabling instant communication between users. The tutorial covers the setup of project directories, initialization of package.json files, installation of dependencies, creation of React components, establishment of real-time communication between the client and server using Socket.IO, and deployment of the application online using Netlify.

## Key Points Covered

- Introduction to the project and its components 
- Setup of project directories and initialization of package.json files 
- Installation of dependencies for client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js) applications 
- Creation of React components for the chat application 
- Utilization of Socket.IO for real-time communication between client and server 
- Deployment of the application online using Netlify 

## Getting Started

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-chat-application.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd real-time-chat-application
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the client-side (React) application:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Install dependencies for the server-side (Node.js) application:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Start the client:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the chat application.
